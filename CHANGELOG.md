# Part 1: Priority-Based Scheduling

## 1.1 Implementation Result and Testing

We have successfully implemented the implemented the priority scheduling into the basekernel. We also created test programs that executed properly.

![Screenshot of scheduler test program](./screenshots/scheduler_test.png)

To use the test programs, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Compile and run basekernel

```bash
make
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom basekernel.iso
```

### Step 2: Mount the disk image

In QEMU:

```bash
kshell > automount
```

### Step 3: Run schedulertest.exe

```bash
kshell > run /bin/schedulertest.exe
```

## 1.2 Abstract Idea and Mechanism Design

Abstract idea: To implement priority-based scheduling, we need to maintain a priority queue of processes. The scheduler will select the process with the smallest priority value to run next.

Mechanism design: The implementation involves three key modifications:

1. Extending `list.h` to support priority queues. `list.h` is a generic linked list implementation that Basekernel uses for FCFS scheduling. We add several functions to support priority-based insertions and deletions, where the priority is stored as the `priority` field in the `list_node` structure.
2. Introducing a temporarily blocked queue in `process.h`. To simulate the scenario where multiple processes arrive at the same time, we need to store the processes in a temporarily blocked queue before they are ready to run. When they are added to the queue, they are sorted based on their priority. Then, the system can take the process with the highest priority from the queue and add it to the ready queue for execution.
3. Adding system calls to allow user programs to interact with the scheduler. This includes scheduling a process with a specific priority and getting the current process's priority.

## 1.3 Implementation Details

`kernel/list.h`, `kernel/list.c`:

- Modified function `void list_push_head(struct list *list, struct list_node *node)`
    - Purpose: Insert a node at the head of the list.
    - Parameters:
        - `list`: The list to insert the node into.
        - `node`: The node to insert.
    - Changes:
        - Added a default priority value of 1024 to the node, so as to make it the lowest priority.
- New function `void list_push_head_priority(struct list *list, struct list_node *node, int pri)`
    - Purpose: Insert a node at the head of the list with a specific priority.
    - Parameters:
        - `list`: The list to insert the node into.
        - `node`: The node to insert.
        - `pri`: The priority of the node.
- Modified function `void list_push_tail(struct list *list, struct list_node *node)`
    - Purpose: Insert a node at the tail of the list.
    - Parameters and changes are the same as `list_push_head`.
- New function `void list_push_tail_priority(struct list *list, struct list_node *node, int pri)`
    - Purpose: Insert a node at the tail of the list with a specific priority.
    - Parameters are the same as `list_push_head_priority`.
- Modified function `void list_push_priority(struct list *list, struct list_node *node, int pri)`
    - Purpose: Insert a node into the list based on its priority.
    - Parameters:

    - Purpose: Create a new process with a specific priority.
    - Parameters:
        - `pri`: The priority of the process.

    - Purpose: Move the highest priority process from the blocked queue to the ready queue.
    - Returns: 0 if successful, 1 if the blocked queue is empty.
- New function `int process_run_blocked_all()`
    - Purpose: Move all processes from the blocked queue to the ready queue based on their priority.
    - Returns: 0 if successful, 1 if the blocked queue is empty.

`include/kernel/syscall.h`, `include/library/syscalls.h`, `kernel/syscall_handler.c`, `library/syscalls.c`:

Adds 4 new system calls:

`user/process1.c`, `user/process2.c`, `user/process3.c`, `user/process4.c`, `user/process5.c`:

- 5 test programs that run and print their PID and priority.
- `void runForSeconds(int seconds)` is used to simulate the process running for a specific number of seconds.

`user/schedulertest.c`:

- A test program that schedules the 5 processes with different priorities and runs them.
- `void schedule_process(const char* exec, int priority)` is used to schedule a process with a specific priority.
    - Note: It will prints error messages if the file does not exist or the execution fails.



# Part 2: Named Pipe

## 2.1 Implementation Result and Testing

We have successfully implemented the named pipe into the base kernel. We also created test programs that executed properly. Follow the steps, and you should get the same output as the screenshot.

![Screenshot of named pipe test programs](./screenshots/named_pipe_test.png)

### Step 1: Set up hard disk

In project directory:

```bash
$ make run
```

Inside QEMU:

```bash
kshell> format ata 0 diskfs
kshell> install atapi 2 ata 0
kshell> mount ata 0 diskfs
```

### Step 2: Run multishell.exe

```bash
kshell> run /bin/multishell.exe
```

### Step 3: Run receiver.exe to create named pipe

Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch to the $\nwarrow$ upper left shell:

```bash
shell> run /bin/receiver.exe
```

This will create a named pipe at the specified path.

Next, switch to the $\swarrow$ lower left shell:

```bash
shell> list /data
```

In the output, you will see the named pipe created by the receiver.

### Step 4: Run sender.exe to send message

Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch to the $\nearrow$â€‹ upper right shell:

```bash
shell> run /bin/sender.exe
```

Sender will open the named pipe, and write message to the pipe.

Then, receiver will print the same message.

Finally, both sender and receiver will exit. Receiver will delete the named pipe.

We can switch to the $\searrow$ lower right shell to verify:

```bash
shell> list /data
```

## 2.2 Abstract Idea and Mechanism Design

Abstract idea: To make a named pipe, we need to create a file in the disk file system, create a named pipe object, and bind the file with the named pipe object. To open the named pipe, we need to find the named pipe object binded with the file. We can then read and write to the named pipe object. We stored the relationship between a file and a named pipe object in the inode of the file.

Mechanism design: The implementation involves several key modifications:

1. Define the structure of a named pipe:

   ```c
   struct named_pipe
   {
     	struct pipe *p;
     	int refcount;
   };
   ```
   
   We reused the original pipe structure to store the data of the named pipe. We also added a reference count to keep track of the number of processes using the named pipe.
   
   * When a process uses syscall to open a named pipe, the reference count is increased.
   * When a process exits, the reference count is decreased. If the reference count becomes zero, the named pipe structure is freed.

2. Extending the `diskfs.c` to support named pipes. We added a new pointer `struct named_pipe *` to the `struct diskfs_inode` to store the named pipe object binded with the file. We also added functions to bind and get the named pipe object from the file.

3. Extending the `fs.c` to support creating and removing files at a given path.

4. Implementing the named pipe operations. We added functions to create, destroy, open, read, and write to the named pipe. The named pipe operations are similar to the pipe operations, but they are more complex because they involve file system operations.

5. Adding a new kobject type `KOBJECT_NAMED_PIPE` to represent the named pipe. We also added functions to create, copy, write, close, and get the size of the named pipe object.

6. Adding system calls to allow user programs to interact with the named pipe. This includes making, destroying, opening the named pipe.

7. Creating a multishell program to test the named pipe operations. The multishell program creates four shells in parallel, allowing us to test the receiver and sender programs simultaneously.
